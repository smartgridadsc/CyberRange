## Smart Grid Cyber Range

We have developed a framework for modelling a smart grid cyber range using an XML-based language, called SG-ML, and for "compiling" the model into an operational cyber range with minimal engineering efforts. The modelling language includes standardized schema from IEC 61850 and IEC 61131, which allows industry players to utilize their existing configurations.  

The SG-ML framework aims at making a smart grid cyber range available to broader user bases to facilitate cybersecurity R&D and hands-on exercises.
