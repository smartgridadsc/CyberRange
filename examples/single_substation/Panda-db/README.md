## Example files for Pandapower Simulation

This folder contains the example input files required for running the Pandapower simulation:
1) SSD file, e.g. EPIC_single_substation.ssd
2) Extra configuration file, e.g. extra_config.xml

To use these files, place them in the corresponding code folder CyberRange/single_substation/Panda-db and follow the instruction in CyberRange/single_substation/Panda-db/README.md.  

For the setup, execute below SQL file once in the database to create the schema:
1) pandapower_db_structure.sql
