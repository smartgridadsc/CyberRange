## Protection Functions between 2 Substations

This folder contains the files to build and run the virtual IEDs with protection functions using multicast communication among IEDs across different substations through the use of SED files.

Refer to the examples/multi_substation/IED_standalone folder for an example.

To build the VIRTUAL_IEDs, place the input files from the example into the subfolder "01_input", then run ./ied_build.sh.
